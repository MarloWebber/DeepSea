Epics ------------



interacting ecosystem of several species

fish can steer itself toward food
	it's not entirely clear why we haven't been able to do this yet.
	- maybe the shape and size of the brain does not permit this logic to occur.
	- maybe the sensory data entering the brain is not sufficient to easily guide the creature.
	- insufficient population and time, or too high mutation rate meaning that more complex solutions can't be resolved.


	having to run the simulation for too long or with too many fish is bad gameplay, so better to improve the first 2.
	it is hard to know what would have to change about the neural layout without a better understanding of how this problem is solved.

	the middle point is the easiest to solve, adding better sensors that do not need as much processing to guide the creature.






In Progress -------------------------




"autosave species on new generation" checkbox

"select n" condition on lab mode selection operations







To Do ---------------------------------------

	mutation adds and removes limbs, neurons, layers, and other brain peripherals




	- an enclosed boundary for the playable area (maps, terrain etc). loadable maps with a physical containment to keep the fish in. rigid polygonal terrain.


	plants which are non-motile animals that photosynthesize and can be eaten



	randomise timer phase on a per-animal basis




Done -----------

	buttons to add and remove neurons in middle layers - done!


	ability to add and remove layers
		- add: done
		- remove:.. done

	sexual reproduction
		- bodies: done
		- ability to combine minds:... done


	- multiple independent species

	- number of food particles maintained in the play area (make it always persistent in lab mode, automatically maintained at level in eco mode by adding new random ones when an old one is eaten)
			- food is persistent always in lab mode, and 



	ecosystem mode reproduction, where instead of replacing all animals in the species, just the 3 who ate the longest time ago are replaced
