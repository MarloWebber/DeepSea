Epics ------------



interacting ecosystem of several species





In Progress -------------------------




"autosave species on new generation" checkbox

"select n" condition on lab mode selection operations







To Do ---------------------------------------



	to finish first release:
		- load nellyfish at start
		- ability to load empty laboratory map
		- portable copy built for release










	mutation adds and removes limbs, neurons, layers, and other brain peripherals
		- nah, that's up to the player or whatever.




	plants which are non-motile animals that photosynthesize and can be eaten
		- plants should grow bones in a radiating pattern. it is a unique and interesting way to show off our hierarchical fish structure that we're not doing right now.
		- the plant is described just like the fish, but instead of being incorporated in one go, they start with just the root segment and spend energy to build the rest as they go.
		- generally, if part of the hierarchy consists of 'leaf' segments, this part must be built from the top down.
		- plants should not really have any sensors and will mostly assume unmoving configurations.




Done -----------

	randomise timer phase on a per-animal basis
	- sort of done, between the removal of timers from the game, and the addition of neural noise, which gives a similar visual impression



	- an enclosed boundary for the playable area (maps, terrain etc). loadable maps with a physical containment to keep the fish in. rigid polygonal terrain.
		- done!

	buttons to add and remove neurons in middle layers - done!


	ability to add and remove layers
		- add: done
		- remove:.. done

	sexual reproduction
		- bodies: done
		- ability to combine minds:... done


	- multiple independent species

	- number of food particles maintained in the play area (make it always persistent in lab mode, automatically maintained at level in eco mode by adding new random ones when an old one is eaten)
			- food is persistent always in lab mode, and 



	ecosystem mode reproduction, where instead of replacing all animals in the species, just the 3 who ate the longest time ago are replaced


	species view window
	-> ability to populate a species from named file
	-> ability to save individual to named file
	-> select and deselect a species
	-> select all members of the species
	-> 


fish can steer itself toward food
	it's not entirely clear why we haven't been able to do this yet.
	- maybe the shape and size of the brain does not permit this logic to occur.
	- maybe the sensory data entering the brain is not sufficient to easily guide the creature.
	- insufficient population and time, or too high mutation rate meaning that more complex solutions can't be resolved.


	having to run the simulation for too long or with too many fish is bad gameplay, so better to improve the first 2.
	it is hard to know what would have to change about the neural layout without a better understanding of how this problem is solved.

	the middle point is the easiest to solve, adding better sensors that do not need as much processing to guide the creature.


		- done.
