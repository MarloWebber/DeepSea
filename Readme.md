DeepSea is an evolution simulator game.

In it, you have a tank of aquarium fish, each controlled by a neural network brain. They can sense and eat food, and reproduce if they collect enough energy.

You can edit their minds and bodies directly, or perform statistical techniques on the population to influence it.

Over time, new forms and swimming styles will evolve. These are not pre-programmed in any way, they are simply discovered by circumstances and randomness.
Every time you play you will see something new.
